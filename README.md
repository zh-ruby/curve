## About the Project

### Context
At Curve, we offer a Savings Vault for crvUSD, an ERC4626 token that allows earning
a "risk-free" interest rate on the crvUSD stablecoin.

When bridging scrvUSD cross-chain, the token loses its ERC4626 capabilities and becomes
a plain ERC20 token that cannot be minted with nor redeemed using crvUSD.

To address this problem, we opted to have secondary scrvUSD markets on all chains where scrvUSD can be redeemed.
Since the price of the asset is not stable, we cannot use a "simple" [stableswap-ng](https://github.com/curvefi/stableswap-ng/blob/fd54b9a1a110d0e2e4f962583761d9e236b70967/contracts/main/CurveStableSwapNG.vy#L17) pool as the price
of the asset would go up as the yield accrues. Fortunately, stableswap-ng supports "oraclized" assets,
which means that we can use an oracle to provide the rate at which the price of the asset is increasing, ensuring that the pool works as expected.

### Problem
It is a hard problem to guarantee the correctness of the value provided by the oracle. If not precise enough, this can
lead to MEV in the liquidity pool, at a loss for the liquidity providers. Even worse, if someone is able to manipulate
this rate, it can lead to the pool being drained from one side.

### Solution

This project contains a solution that fetches scrvUSD vault parameters from Ethereum, and provides them on other
chains, with the goal of being able to compute the growth rate in a safe (non-manipulable) and precise 
(no losses due to approximation) way. Furthermore, this oracle can allow creating stableswap-ng pools for other assets
like USDC/scrvUSD, FRAX/scrvUSD, etc.

### Implementation details

Since the actual scrvUSD price is subject to changes on Ethereum,
it's impossible to predict the price with 100% certainty on other networks unless the price is taken at a given timestamp or some assumptions on scrvUSD behavior are introduced.  
Hence, the initial version named `v0` simply replicates scrvUSD and returns the real price at some timestamp.
Considering the price is always growing, `v0` can be used as a lower bound.  
`v1` introduces the assumption that no one interacts with scrvUSD further on.
This means that rewards are being distributed as is, stopping at the end of the period.
And no new deposits/withdrawals alter the rate.
This already gives a great assumption to the price over the distribution period,
because the rate is more or less stable over a 1-week period and small declines do not matter.  
`v2` adds an assumption that rewards denominated in crvUSD are equal across subsequent periods.
This is considered to approximate when rates are stable over a long period of time,
especially when the market is calm.

### Blockhash oracle

It is out of scope, so listing general assumptions:
1. It can be updated frequently with a mainnet blockhash that is no older than, say, 30 minutes. The minimal delay is 64 blocks to avoid any potential mainnet reorg risks.
2. It can __rarely__ provide an incorrect blockhash, but not an incorrect block number. Thus, a new update with a fresh block number will correct the parameters.

For curious readers, native blockhash feed solutions (like OP stack [pre-compile](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0x4200000000000000000000000000000000000015#readProxyContract)) will be used with LayerZero for other networks as a "temporary" solution.

### Parameters

Spread from fee makes it impossible to manipulate the pool with changes up to the fee.
Taking the minimum pool fee as 1bps means that the oracle should not jump more than 1 bps per block.
And for extra safety, take 0.5bps as a safe threshold.  
Smoothing is introduced for sudden updates, so the price slowly catches up with the price, while the pool is being arbitraged safely.
Though, smoothing limits the upper bound of price growth.
Therefore, we consider that scrvUSD will never be over 60% APR.

Also, it is worth noting that the oracle is controlled by a DAO and its parameters can be changed by a vote.

## Actors

```
Actors:
    Prover: An off-chain prover (from now on, the prover) whose role is to fetch data from Ethereum that are useful for computing the growth rate of the vault, along with a proof that the data are valid.
    Verifier: A smart contract that will be called by the prover to verify the data provided along with its proof.
    Oracle: A smart contract that will provide the current price of scrvUSD, given the growth rate of the vault provided by the prover and verified by the verifier, to be used by the stableswap-ng pool on the target chain.
    Blockhash oracle: A smart contract providing Ethereum blockhash or stateroot for verifying scrvUSD storage variables.
